# Project Name: Weather web application

# Current Version: 1.0.1

# Description:

My task is to create a simple weather app that will fetch a city's current
weather. To accomplish this I have selected OpenWeather company's: Current
Weather API as it is open source and easy to use.

# Version History:

_Version 1.0.1:_

Updated the file structure and relocated the API key to an env variable.

I also updated to the latest webpack version which resulted in changes to the
webpack.config file.

_Version 1.0.0:_

As of right now, the weather application will work with all cities in Canada. In
the future I plan to add support for other countries. But for now I must move on
with my studies.
